["Carry out a random act of kindness, with no expectation of reward, safe in the knowledge that one day someone might do the same for you.","If you find someone you love in your life, then hang on to that love.","Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less.","Do not dwell in the past, do not dream of the future, concentrate the mind on the present moment."]
